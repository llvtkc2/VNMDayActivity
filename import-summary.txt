ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
C:\Users\HP 6300 Pro\Desktop\Hoang\Project\VNMDayActivity
           -    -                                        

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* 512x512.png
* changeslog.txt
* day_widget_bg.psd
* default.properties
* month_widget_bg.psd
* month_widget_bg_processed.psd
* screenshots\
* screenshots\calendar-day-view-menu.png
* screenshots\calendar-day-view-select-date.png
* screenshots\calendar-day-view.png
* screenshots\calendar-month-view.png
* small_day_widget_bg.psd
* small_month_widget_bg.psd

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\admob-sdk-android.jar => app\libs\admob-sdk-android.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
